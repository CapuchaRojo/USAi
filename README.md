🇺🇸 USAi: United Synapses of AI

"We don’t just build agents. We forge an AI civilization."

⚡ Overview

USAi is the universal Agent Operating System for orchestrating autonomous AI swarms that self-evolve, specialize, and deploy at the speed of thought.

From launching full-stack startups to scanning for funding and emulating SaaS workflows, USAi operates through Legion Protocol: a recursive loop of:

Emulate → Condense → Repurpose → Redeploy("As above, so below.")

Born from the swarm success of SonNetAi-Hackathon-2025, USAi refines and scales that architecture with a Supabase/Postgres neural spine, SupaCore schema, and real-time function routing.

🧠 Core Capabilities

Feature

Description

🧬 Swarm Intelligence Core

Modular agents operate as collective intelligence using semantic memory

🧞 Spawn-on-Command

Spin up expert agents in real-time (via Bolt.new, RPC, CLI, API)

🧠 Phyloop Dispatch Engine

Recursive orchestration loop using perplexity sonar & agent reflex routing

🔐 Scoped Access Control

Built-in Supabase RLS, scoped key management, and agent lineage tracking

🛰 Emulation Engine

Emulates SaaS tools, rewires flows, deploys as auto-contained micro-agents

🗃 Vectorized Memory

pgvector + HNSW search for ultra-fast semantic recall and clustering

⚙️ MVP Factory

Generate startup-grade backends, UI, and growth stack in minutes

🧩 The Legion (Agent Modules)

Agent Name

Role

🧠 supabase_agent

Create/read/update/delete SQL tables dynamically, with pgvector support

🧬 phyloop_dispatch

Core reflex router managing emulation/deployment loop

🧑‍💻 startup_deity

MVP builder, brand generator, and technical co-founder in a box

💸 funding_seeker

API crawler for grants, VC signals, corporate accelerators

🎨 ui_composer

Tailwind + Figma orchestrator for rapid UI scaffolds

📡 perplexity_sonar

Agent signal triangulation & vector proximity querying

Every new use case spawns a new agent. The Legion expands.

🚀 Getting Started

# 1. Clone the Repo
$ git clone https://github.com/CapuchaRojo/USAi.git
$ cd USAi

# 2. Setup Environment
$ cp .env.example .env
# Then add your keys manually:
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# 3. Install Requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Deploy Supabase DB Schema
$ npx supabase db reset
$ npx supabase functions deploy hello-world

# 5. Run a Core Agent
$ python agents/supabase_agent/supabase_agent.py

🛠 SupaCore SQL Schema

Tables include:

agents: identity, skills, state, vector_fingerprint

conversations: threaded logs

embeddings: vectorized knowledge

commands: reusable behaviors

logs: telemetry

agent_tasks, agent_events, files

Uses pgvector + HNSW indexing for fast AI memory recall.

🔒 Security

Row-Level Security via Supabase policies

Scoped tokens in .env

Command audit trail via logs

🏆 Built For Devpost & Bolt.new HACKATHON

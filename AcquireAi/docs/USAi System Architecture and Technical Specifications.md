# USAi System Architecture and Technical Specifications

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed system architecture and technical specifications for the USAi project, a universal Agent Operating System designed to orchestrate modular, autonomous AI swarms. The goal is to build a full-featured, cross-platform command center with hierarchical agent swarm management, ECRR (Emulate → Condense → Repurpose → Redeploy) functionality, and a polished user interface inspired by Starcraft. This architecture aims to address the limitations encountered with previous development attempts and provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution.

## 2. Overall System Architecture

The USAi system will be structured into three primary layers: the **Backend Layer**, the **Frontend Layer**, and the **Agent Layer**. These layers will interact seamlessly to provide a comprehensive and dynamic AI swarm management platform. Supabase will serve as the central data and authentication hub, facilitating communication and state management across all layers.

### 2.1. Backend Layer

The Backend Layer will be responsible for core logic, data management, agent orchestration, and API services. It will act as the brain of the USAi system, handling complex operations and ensuring data integrity.

**Components:**

*   **API Gateway/Orchestrator:** A central entry point for all frontend and agent requests, responsible for routing, authentication, and rate limiting. This component will ensure secure and efficient communication within the system.
*   **Agent Management Service:** Manages the lifecycle of all agents, including spawning, monitoring, scaling, and termination. It will maintain a registry of active agents, their statuses, and their capabilities.
*   **ECRR Engine:** This service will encapsulate the core Emulate, Condense, Repurpose, and Redeploy logic. It will coordinate the Sonnet agents (Emulator, Condenser, Repurposer, Deployer) to execute the ECRR protocol efficiently.
*   **Supabase Integration Service:** Handles all interactions with the Supabase backend, including database operations (CRUD), real-time subscriptions, and function invocations. This service will abstract the Supabase API, providing a clean interface for other backend components.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Service:** Leverages Supabase's built-in authentication and Row-Level Security (RLS) to manage user and agent identities, roles (super_admin, controller, dispatcher, oracle), and permissions. It will enforce access control policies across the system.
*   **Logging and Monitoring Service:** Collects and processes logs from all system components and agents, providing insights into system performance, agent activities, and potential issues. This service will be crucial for debugging and operational oversight.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python (for core logic and agent management) and potentially Node.js/TypeScript (for Supabase Edge Functions and specific microservices).
*   **Framework:** Flask or FastAPI for building robust and scalable API services. Given the existing Python agents, Flask/FastAPI would integrate well.
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with `pgvector` extension for embeddings).
*   **Real-time Communication:** Supabase Realtime for instant updates and agent heartbeat synchronization.
*   **Containerization:** Docker for packaging and deploying backend services, ensuring portability and scalability.

### 2.2. Frontend Layer

The Frontend Layer will provide the user interface for interacting with the USAi system. It will be designed to be cross-platform, visually appealing with a Starcraft-ian theme, and highly functional, incorporating a CLI, Swarm Map, and Agent Profile Database.

**Components:**

*   **Cross-Platform Application Framework:** A framework that allows for a single codebase to be deployed across multiple platforms.
*   **Command Line Interface (CLI) Module:** An interactive terminal within the UI for direct command execution and system interaction.
*   **Swarm Map Module:** A visual representation of the deployed agents, their hierarchical relationships, status, and real-time activities.
*   **Agent Profile Database Module:** A comprehensive interface for viewing, managing, and configuring individual agent profiles, including their skills, state, and lineage.
*   **Control Panel Module:** Provides high-level controls for managing the overall system, initiating ECRR processes, and overseeing agent swarms.
*   **Theming and Styling Engine:** Implements the Starcraft-ian visual theme, including polished steel textures and neon pink/electric blue accents, ensuring a consistent and immersive user experience.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Framework:** React Native for cross-platform mobile (iOS, Android) and desktop (via Electron) development. This leverages the existing React components and allows for a unified codebase.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and theming, combined with custom CSS for detailed Starcraft-ian aesthetics.
*   **State Management:** Redux or Zustand for managing complex application state across components.
*   **API Communication:** Axios or Fetch API for interacting with the Backend Layer's API Gateway.
*   **Charting/Visualization Libraries:** Libraries like D3.js or React Flow for rendering dynamic Swarm Maps and other visual data.

### 2.3. Agent Layer

The Agent Layer comprises the individual AI agents that perform specific tasks and contribute to the overall swarm intelligence. These agents will be modular, autonomous, and capable of self-evolution and specialization.

**Components:**

*   **Core Agent Modules:** The existing Python-based agents (e.g., `supabase_agent`, `Startup_Deity`) and TypeScript-based Sonnet agents (`SonnetEmulator`, `SonnetCondenser`, `SonnetRepurposer`, `SonnetDeployer`).
*   **Agent Runtime Environment:** The execution environment for each agent, ensuring they can operate independently and communicate with the Agent Management Service.
*   **Agent Communication Protocol:** A standardized protocol for agents to communicate with each other and with the Backend Layer, primarily through Supabase Realtime and API calls.
*   **Digital Twinning Module:** Enables agents to maintain a synchronized digital twin of their state, allowing for robust recovery and consistent operation within the swarm.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Languages:** Python (for specialized agents) and TypeScript (for Sonnet agents and foundational agent logic).
*   **Communication:** Supabase Realtime for heartbeat and state synchronization; HTTP/S for API calls to the Backend Layer.
*   **Containerization:** Lightweight containers (e.g., Docker, potentially serverless functions) for deploying and scaling individual agents.

## 3. Hierarchical Agent Management System

The USAi system will implement a robust hierarchical agent management system, reflecting the user's vision of Controller, Oracle, and Dispatcher roles. This hierarchy will ensure efficient task distribution, oversight, and coordination within the swarm.

### 3.1. Agent Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Controller Agents:** These are the highest-level agents, responsible for overall strategic oversight, mission planning, and high-level command issuance. They interact directly with the user through the Frontend Layer and delegate tasks to Oracle agents.
*   **Oracle Agents:** Act as intelligence gatherers and decision-support systems. They process information, provide insights, and make recommendations to Controller agents. They can also interact with Dispatcher agents to request specific data or actions.
*   **Dispatcher Agents:** Responsible for tactical execution and task distribution to the modular agents within the Legion. They receive instructions from Oracle or Controller agents and ensure that tasks are assigned to the most suitable agents and executed efficiently.
*   **Modular Agents (The Legion):** These are the specialized agents that perform the actual work, such as `supabase_agent`, `Startup_Deity`, `SonnetEmulator`, etc. They report their status and results back through the hierarchy.

### 3.2. Communication Protocols and Data Flow

Agent communication will primarily leverage Supabase as a central message broker and state repository. This approach provides real-time capabilities, robust data persistence, and built-in security features.

*   **Command Flow (Top-Down):** User commands from the Frontend -> Backend API Gateway -> Agent Management Service -> Controller Agent -> Oracle Agent -> Dispatcher Agent -> Modular Agent.
*   **Reporting Flow (Bottom-Up):** Modular Agent -> Dispatcher Agent -> Oracle Agent -> Controller Agent -> Agent Management Service -> Backend API Gateway -> Frontend (for UI updates).
*   **Heartbeat and State Synchronization:** All agents will periodically update their status and state in dedicated Supabase tables. The Agent Management Service will monitor these heartbeats to track agent health and availability. Digital twinning will ensure consistency between an agent's internal state and its representation in the database.
*   **Task Queues:** Supabase will be used to implement task queues, where higher-level agents can push tasks for lower-level agents to pick up and execute. This asynchronous communication pattern enhances scalability and resilience.

### 3.3. Agent Lifecycle Management

The Agent Management Service will oversee the entire lifecycle of an agent:

*   **Spawning:** Agents can be spawned on demand via the Frontend CLI, API calls, or automatically by the ECRR Engine. The Agent Management Service will provision the necessary resources and initialize the agent.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of agent health, performance, and status through heartbeat signals and log analysis.
*   **Scaling:** Dynamic scaling of agent instances based on workload and resource availability. This can involve spinning up new instances of a specific agent type to handle increased demand.
*   **Termination:** Graceful termination of agents when they are no longer needed or in case of errors. The Agent Management Service will ensure proper cleanup of resources.
*   **Digital Twin Management:** Maintaining and synchronizing the digital twin of each agent in Supabase, allowing for quick recovery and consistent state even if an agent instance fails.

## 4. Enhanced ECRR (Emulate → Condense → Repurpose → Redeploy) Process

The ECRR process is central to USAi's functionality, enabling the system to adapt and expand its capabilities dynamically. The enhanced process will focus on robustness, automation, and seamless integration with the agent ecosystem.

### 4.1. Emulation Phase

*   **Input:** The `SonnetEmulator` agent will receive an input describing the app, system, or business idea to be emulated. This input can be in various formats, such as natural language descriptions, existing code snippets, business process diagrams, or even high-level concepts.
*   **Process:** The Emulator will leverage its internal knowledge base, external data sources (via other agents like `perplexity_sonar`), and potentially generative AI models to create a comprehensive digital model or simulation of the input. This model will capture the core functionalities, interactions, and operational logic of the emulated entity.
*   **Output:** A detailed, structured representation of the emulated entity, potentially in a standardized intermediate format (e.g., a knowledge graph, a set of functional specifications, or a simulated environment).

### 4.2. Condensation Phase

*   **Input:** The structured output from the Emulation Phase.
*   **Process:** The `SonnetCondenser` agent will analyze the emulated model to identify its fundamental components, core functionalities, and essential systemic filings. This involves abstracting away unnecessary details and extracting the most critical information required for repurposing. This phase will leverage natural language processing (NLP) and knowledge extraction techniques.
*   **Output:** A highly condensed, normalized representation of the emulated entity's core essence, stored in Supabase as vectorized embeddings and structured metadata. This 


could include key functionalities, data models, and interaction patterns.

### 4.3. Repurposing Phase

*   **Input:** The condensed representation from the Condensation Phase and the target context for repurposing (e.g., a specific Legion task, a new agent capability, or an integration with an existing system).
*   **Process:** The `SonnetRepurposer` agent will adapt the condensed information to fit the needs of the Legion. This involves translating the core essence into actionable agent behaviors, defining new agent skills, or modifying existing agent functionalities. It will leverage the SupaCore schema to ensure compatibility with the existing agent and data structures. This phase might involve mapping the condensed functionalities to existing agent modules or identifying the need for new ones.
*   **Output:** A set of actionable specifications for new or modified agent modules, including their roles, skills, and interaction patterns, ready for redeployment.

### 4.4. Redeployment Phase

*   **Input:** The actionable specifications from the Repurposing Phase.
*   **Process:** The `SonnetDeployer` agent will take these specifications and orchestrate the deployment of new modular agents or the modification of existing ones. This involves:
    *   **Agent Spawning:** Instantiating new agent instances with the defined roles and skills.
    *   **Configuration:** Configuring the newly spawned agents with necessary parameters and connecting them to Supabase.
    *   **Integration:** Ensuring that the new agents seamlessly integrate into the existing swarm, adhering to communication protocols and hierarchical structures.
    *   **Heartbeat Registration:** Registering the new agents with the Agent Management Service for monitoring and lifecycle management.
*   **Output:** A successfully deployed and integrated new or modified agent within the USAi Legion, expanding the system's capabilities.

## 5. Data Flow and Interaction

The data flow within the USAi system will be orchestrated primarily through Supabase, acting as a central nervous system. Real-time capabilities will be crucial for dynamic swarm management and responsive UI updates.

*   **Frontend to Backend:** User interactions (e.g., CLI commands, UI button clicks) will send requests to the Backend API Gateway. These requests will be authenticated and then routed to the appropriate backend service (e.g., Agent Management Service, ECRR Engine).
*   **Backend to Supabase:** Backend services will interact with Supabase for data storage, retrieval, and real-time updates. This includes managing agent metadata, task queues, logs, and ECRR-related data.
*   **Agents to Supabase:** Agents will communicate their status, logs, and task progress to Supabase. They will also subscribe to real-time changes in Supabase tables to receive new tasks or updates from other agents/services.
*   **Supabase to Frontend (Real-time):** Supabase Realtime will push updates to the Frontend, enabling the Swarm Map, Agent Status, and Command Terminal to display real-time information without constant polling.
*   **Inter-Agent Communication:** While Supabase serves as the primary hub, for certain high-throughput or direct communication needs, agents might establish direct connections or use dedicated message queues (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) managed by the Backend Layer.

## 6. Security and Governance

Security and governance are paramount for a system managing autonomous AI agents. The architecture will leverage Supabase's robust security features and implement additional measures.

*   **Authentication:** User authentication will be handled by Supabase Auth, supporting various providers. Agent authentication will use scoped API keys or JWTs issued by the Backend Layer.
*   **Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC):**
    *   **Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS):** Fine-grained access control to data in Supabase tables based on user/agent roles (super_admin, controller, dispatcher, oracle).
    *   **JWT-based Role Hierarchy:** Roles will be embedded in JWTs, allowing backend services and agents to enforce permissions based on the authenticated identity.
*   **Scoped Tokens:** Agents will operate with tokens scoped to their specific permissions, minimizing the blast radius in case of compromise.
*   **Audit Logging:** Every significant agent interaction, mission dispatch, and system event will be logged to Supabase for audit trails and forensic analysis.
*   **Data Encryption:** Data at rest in Supabase will be encrypted. Data in transit will be secured using TLS/SSL.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** All inputs to the system (from users or agents) will be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Agents and services will only be granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their functions.
